### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 3rd-year student at BUPT as an Artificial Intelligence Major, specializing in Scene Graph Generation and VLM for Embodied Agent. Currently, I am working as an Undergraduate Research in the NTU@MMLAB Group. 

**My goal is to make an AI agent ðŸ¤– behave like a human, thereby helping others lead better lives.**
